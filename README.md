# Overview
This course project is to predict the class of exercise the individual was performing using use machine learning algorithms. Data for the project is based on devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit, using which now it is possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively.

Variable “classe” classifies the correct and incorrect outcomes of A, B, C, D, and E categories.

Class A - exactly according to the specification
Class B - throwing the elbows to the front
Class C - lifting the dumbbell only halfway
Class D - lowering the dumbbell only halfway
Class E - throwing the hips to the front
Analysis for the project will identify the best model (with highest accuracy) and use it to predict “classe” variable in the test data.
